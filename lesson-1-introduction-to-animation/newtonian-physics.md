###Newton's Laws of Motion

**First Law:**

Objects in motion tend to stay in motion and objects at rest tend to stay at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force

**Second Law:**

Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma)

**Third Law**

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
