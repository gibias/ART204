#### 12. Appeal

**Appeal** is perhaps the hardest principle to achieve among all 12 principles we have learned in this unit. Appeal is something an animation has or lacks. Characters that are too complicated or too simplistic lack appeal. The same is true for all elements of an animation, from characters, to background, timing, and camera work. Appeal is the result of all principles we have learned in this section successfully applied together, creating an animation that is interesting to the eye and draws the viewerâ€™s attention.

During this course you will learn best practices on how to make good animations and will train your eyes to differentiate uninteresting from appealing results.
