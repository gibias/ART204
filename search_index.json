We will also discuss the principles that apply to all kinds of animation, from hand drawn to computer generated. These principles are the base to understand what animation is made of, and how it can bring even simple shapes like a rectangle or a circle to life. This unit will also give you an understanding of the differences between good and bad animation, so you can apply good practices to create more engaging and thoughtful animations of your own.\nThroughout the unit you will work on hands-on animation exercises, which will be the foundation of every animated work you create from then on, and you will take the first steps towards your final animation project. At the end of this unit you will have learned and exercised the basic principles of animation and the art of storytelling.\nScreening\nSteamboat Willie, Walt Disney Animation Studios (1928)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgghnQF6E4\n“The Hero's Journey”, by Iskander Krayenbosch (2015)\nhttps://vimeo.com/140767141\nThe illusion of life, by Cento Lodigiani (2014)\nhttps://vimeo.com/93206523\n"},"lesson-1-introduction-to-animation.html":{"url":"lesson-1-introduction-to-animation.html","title":"Lesson 1 - Introduction to Animation","keywords":"","body":"Lesson 1 - Introduction to Animation\nIn this lesson we will discuss the history of animation from the beginning of the 19th century until the present day.

In this lesson you will learn about the history of animation, exploring the evolution of early animation devices into modern animation techniques.\nBefore Film\nImages in motion were depicted as early as humans started recording their experiences through painting in paleolithic times. Drawings, carvings, and sculptures portraying human and animal activity in motion can be found in the walls of caves, utensils such as pottery, and even built structures. In the beginning of the 19th century a series of devices started to emerge, setting the stage for modern animation techniques. Some of these early animation devices are:\n####1820s: Thaumatrope The thaumatrope was invented in the 1820s and consists of a disk with an image on each side connected to two pieces of string. Turning the strings between the fingers caused the image to spin, creating the illusion that both images are one.\n\n\nThaumatrope in motion\n1831: Phenakistoscope\nThe phenakistoscope, invented in 1831, was a disk containing several still images depicting a sequence in motion. The disk was attached to a handle and contained equally spaced slits through which the user could see the spinning images. The phenakistoscope is often compared to modern gif images, because it shows a sequence of images playing on a loop.\n\nPhenakistoscope by Eadweard Muybridge\n\n1834: Zoetrope\nSimilar to the phenakistoscope, the zoetrope also presents a sequence of spinning images that create the illusion of motion. Rather than placed on a flat disk, however, in the zoetrope the images are distributed on the wall of a cylinder with equally spaced slits through which the animation can be viewed. Different from the phenakistoscope that can be experienced only by one person at a time, the zoetrope allows for several users to enjoy the experience.\n\nZoetrope W.E. Lincoln, 1867\n\n1868: Flip book\nIn 1868 the first flipbook, the kinograph, was developed by John Barnes Linnett. It consisted of a small book with a sequence of images in motion individually drawn on each page. When flipping through the pages, the images appear to be moving.\n\nLinnet kineograph 1886\n\n1877: Praxinoscope\nA more elaborate version of the Zoetrope, the praxinoscope was invented in 1877 by Charles-Émile Reynaud and consisted of a carousel of sequential still images with a mirror placed in the center. The mirror substituted the slits on the zoetrope and reflected the images of the spinning carousel creating the illusion of motion. In 1889 Reynaud presented an improved version of the praxinoscope, the Théâtre Optique, capable of projecting images to a screen.\n\nPraxinoscope\n\nFirst public performance of Reynaud's 'Theatre Optique' in Paris 1892\nAfter Film - Traditional Animation\nIn the beginning of the 1900s the first animated films started to emerge. Through the development of what would be later known as traditional animation, animators created individually hand-drawn frames to create scenes in motion. In early animated films (such as ‘Gertie the Dinosaur’, presented in more detail below) complete scenes (background and characters in motion) were drawn on each individual frame. Frames were then photographed and played in sequence to create the illusion of motion. This technique resulted in a ‘jittery’ effect, since there were small variations in the elements on the background from one frame to the next. Later on, with the advent of animation cels (invented in 1914 by Earl Hurd), elements from the background could be drawn separately from characters, which were drawn in transparent sheets and later superimposed to the background. As a result, the animation process was optimized (less elements had to be drawn on each frame) and animations became more stable (elements in the background were exactly the same from frame to frame). Here are some of the most important animation films using traditional animation techniques:\n1908 - Fantasmagorie\nCreated by Émile Cohl, Fantasmagorie was the first animated film developed using traditional animation techniques. The film consisted of a white stick-figure encountering and interacting with various figures that would morph into one another and into the background. Émile hand-drew each frame and shot all frames using negative film, giving the film its white figures/black background appearence.\n.GIF)\nFrame from Fantasmagorie\n1914 - Gertie the Dinosaur\nCreated by the American cartoonist Winsor McCay, Gertie the Dinosaur was the first animated film that combined live action with hand-drawn animation. The film starts at the National History Museum, where McCay bets a colleague he can bring the dinosaurs back to life through drawings. He then proceeds to create 10,000 drawings, one slightly different from the other. In a scene, a boy comes to collect some of the drawings and ends up falling due to the immense quantity of them, showing the sheer size of the endeavour that was the animation process. Around 10 minutes into the film, Gertie would appear and follow McCay’s commands (for example, to bow, raise its foot, and so on). Gertie the Dinosaur was the first animated film to use \"McCay Split System\", today known as keyframes, in which key positions were drawn first and the spaces between key positions were later filled by intermediate positions.\n_Gertie_the_Dinosaur_-_Gerite_carries_MccCay_in_her_mouth.jpg)\nFrame from Gertie the Dinosaur\n1919 - Felix the Cat\nFelix the Cat, created in 1919 by Otto Messmer from Pat Sullivan Studios, was a silent cartoon that impressed and attracted audiences by the qualities of its character and its extraordinary situations. So much that Felix the Cat was the first animated film to be merchandised (into ceramics, postcards, stuffed toys, and so on). The cartoon Felix the Cat was updated in 1953 and began airing in the United States. The new cartoon featured new characters, and Felix with a slightly changed appearance and a \"Magic Bag of Tricks\".\n\nOn the left, Felix in Felix in Hollywood (1923), on the right, Felix current design\n1928 - Steamboat Willie\nWalt Disney’s Steamboat Willie is perhaps the most well known animated film from its time. It was the first animated film to feature synchronized sound and a fully post-produced soundtrack. In the story, a mouse (Mickey Mouse) alternates working with making music. This was the third animated film to feature Mickey Mouse, but the first to be distributed. Steamboat Willie was acclaimed by its technical advancements and it was the first breakthrough for Walt Disney and his company, which is a reference in animation to this date.\n\nFrame from Steamboat Willie\n1937 - Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs, produced by Walt Disney Productions in 1937, was the first cel animated feature film (over 40 minutes long), completely hand-drawn. Based on a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, Snow White tells the story of a princess who escapes the tyranny of her evil queen and finds refuge in the home of seven dwarfs. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs achieved immense success and became a cultural landmark that persists to this date.\n\nFrame from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n1960s - 1980s: Cartoons\nPopularization and Saturday Morning Cartoons In the 1960s, following the increasing popularity of home color televisions (introduced in the United States in 1951), many studios started to adapt and to create cartoons for TV. Animated series such as Tom Terrific (1957), The Huckleberry Hound Show (1958), and The Flintstones (1960) were released and rapidly gained popularity. By the end of this period, cartoons had become commonplace in American TV.\n\nTitle screen from The Flintstones\n1980s - Present\nContemporary Digital Animation With the evolution of computers and computer generated graphics (CGI), the animation industry gained new tools to create animated films. Cartoons gradually stopped being drawn by hand and morphed into 2D computer graphics, and later into 3D animations. An example of this is the TV animated series The Simpsons. Created by Matt Groening in 1987, the series was originally hand-drawn and today is completed generated with the use of CGI. The series even uses 3D environments for some of its scenes. Other contemporary animated films use 3D environments and characters exclusively. This is the case of Toy Story, the first fully computer-animated feature film, produced by Pixar in 1995.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nToy Story\nIt is important to highlight, however, that the development of CGI doesn’t mean a complete break from the way animation was done at the beginning of the 20th century. Many of the techniques and the principles used in traditional animation remain the same to this day.\n"},"exercise--3.html":{"url":"exercise--3.html","title":"Exercise 3.1","keywords":"","body":"Exercise 3.1 - Refined bouncing ball\nAnimate a bouncing ball moving from left to right until it reaches a full stop.

Now it is time to fill in the gaps between those frames, creating a more complete visual outline in the form of a storyboard.\nAs seen in Lesson 1, storyboards are a collection of images/illustrations that show a story in chronological order. Different from a comic strip, which shows only selected moments as snapshots of the narrative, storyboards are more comprehensive, using more frames to depict the various moments of the story, and are the first step in bringing your animation to life. \nGuidelines\nBased on the short story you have created in Exercise 2.2 and the comic strip you have created in Exercise 3.2, create a storyboard for your character’s journey. Refer back to Lesson 1 for details and an example on how to create a storyboard. Remember, you must represent how your character(s), location(s), and the action “moves” from one scene to the next.\nKeep in mind that you will use this storyboard on your final project, so you want it to be as detailed and clear as possible, so you can think through your ideas and get useful feedback before you create your final animation.\nSteps to completion\n\nStart with the 3-4 frames you have created for your comic strip. Which frames are missing and should be added so you can tell your story in a more linear way? Think about the in-between frames that were left to the imagination of the viewer in your comic strip, but that could be part of an animation and should be represented in your storyboard. Run your story through your mind. \nIn a piece of paper draw a series of blank rectangles (by hand, or using Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop). First, fill in the ones you had on your comic strip. Next, start filling in the blank ones. It may help to draw each frame in a separate piece of paper that you can organize on a pin-board or desk (or your computer screen), so it is easier to rearrange them and add additional frames.\nYour drawings don't need to be as detailed as your comic strip, but they should have sufficient detail so each scene is clear. Don’t forget to indicate how the camera should move from one frame to the next (is it zooming in, panning left/right, tilting up/down?). \nWrite short descriptions for each frame, adding as much detail as needed to help you think through your final animation. Run your story in your mind again. Do you have all the frames and details you need?\n\nAt this point your storyboard page should look really messy, with a lot of notes and ideas floating around your frames. Redraw your storyboard, making sure to keep all relevant information and to add anything that was missing on the first round. \nKeep in mind that this is an iterative process, so don’t be afraid to move on to a new version, but always keep the older ones for reference (if you are using a computer, this means saving different versions of your file as you progress). \n\nTake a final look and create the final version of your storyboard by hand, or using Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.\n\nPost your final comic strip as a PDF file to the course page following this naming convention:\nart204_project1_lastname_firstname.pdf\n\n\n"},"unit2.html":{"url":"unit2.html","title":"Unit 2","keywords":"","body":"Unit 2\nDigital Animation\nOverview\nIn Unit 1 you have learned about the history of animation, storytelling, and pre-production. You have also learned basic animation principles devised by Disney animators in the 1930s, which continue to be used in the creation of believable and memorable animations to this day. In this unit we will move into digital animation. With the evolution of technology and the advent of computers and software, the animation process is now simplified (and even completely generated) in digital form. As we delve into digital animation processes, we will talk about the differences between this new medium and traditional animation. We will also discuss how we can apply the animation principles we saw in Unit 1 in the creation of digital animations using Adobe After Effects. In this unit you will create your own digital animations combining text and music.

Both are based on the exact same principles, but digital animation uses computer programs to simplify some of its processes.\nSome of these programs still try to replicate the hand-drawn, frame by frame experience, but most modern animation programs use a different approach that greatly speeds-up the animation process. One of these programs is Adobe After Effects, and this is what we will be using in this course.\n2D animation is just one of the many capabilities of After Effects. For this reason the program can be a little bit overwhelming at first. Please watch this introductory video to have a better sense of the software's interface and and general functionality before we can continue to our next exercises.\nCompositions\nCompositions (or comps) are containers of elements inside of After Effects. Comps have their own independent timelines and layer hierarchy. Based on the complexity of your animation you can have one comp, or hundreds of them. It all depends on the number of elements that needs to be animated.\nComps can have many different roles in you project. Since comps can be nested, they are essential to organize your animation and create a hierarchy inside After Effects. As an example, you can have an animated bouncing ball element in one comp, and a background environment animation in another. You can group and edit these two animations inside a third comp, that in this case will be a scene. If you have multiple scenes, you can then group and edit them all together in a bigger comp, which could contain your entire animation.\nThe first thing you do when starting a new project in After Effects is create a new composition, and assets from Photoshop and Illustrator are imported in After Effects as compositions, giving you access to their separate layers and timelines.\nLayers\nMuch like in Photoshop and Illustrator, layers in After Effects are used to define an element in a scene, and if that element will be in front or behind another element. Each layer can be animated separately and has its own set of animation properties.\n\nAnimation Properties\nEvery element in After Effects has a few base properties that will define its animation. The most important properties are position, scale, rotation and opacity.\nHere is a quick example of these properties in After Effects:\n\n\nPosition defines where the element is on screen over time.\nScale defines the size of the element over time.\nRotation defines the degree of rotation of the element over time.\nOpacity defines the transparency of the element over time.\n\nThese properties cover pretty much all of the animations we will create, and when coupled with masks, they consist of the core of digital animation and motion design.\nHow to access animation properties in After Effects:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1VoHUsqFKbggAP4p7NS8uy6Mb9qfjSxNf\nA mask is not an animation property, but masks are very important and are used extensively in digital animation. They are a little bit different because they need two elements to work: the animation element (in the example above, the square) and the mask itself (the rectangle that animates over the square).\nHow to use masks in After Effects:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1cCvOG6OQVuorO-W6-NbUImJNLEBp0IMQ\nKeyframes\nIn traditional animation, we generally think in terms of frames and how they are defined by importance (keyframes, extremes and inbetweens). These concepts are also important in digital animation, but there is a shift in the way you work and understand them. For example, once you create keyframes for an element in After Effects, the software will automatically fill in the gaps with inbetweens. Most of the time, it is not necessary to worry about extremes and inbetweens at all because a lot of the work is done on the keyframes themselves, through speed and easing options.\nIn After Effects, when you create a keyframe, that keyframe is automatically set as a linear keyframe.   \nThis is what linear keyframes look like:\n\nWhen you have two linear keyframes like that, it means that the timing and spacing between those keyframes is constant and that animation doesn’t have any kind of easing.\nTo apply easing to your keyframes all you have to do is select the keyframes, click with the right mouse button, then select Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease. Your keyframes now will look like this:\n\nThis will create an effect as if the inbetweens are grouped closer to the keyframes, creating smoother acceleration and deceleration. The great thing about easing keyframes in After Effects is that it can be applied to any animation property: position, scale, rotation and even opacity.\nRendering\nRendering is the process of finalizing and exporting your animation as a video file that can be viewed outside of After Effects. It involves taking all of the layers, compositions and effects you have in a project and flattening everything into individual frames. Depending on the number of layers, compositions and effects a project has, rendering an animation can take just a few seconds, or a very (very) long time, so don't wait until the last day on your deadline to start rendering an animation.\n"},"digital-animation-properties.html":{"url":"digital-animation-properties.html","title":"Digital Animation Process","keywords":"","body":"Digital Animation Process\nAsset creation\nAsset creation is the process of drawing your characters, props and environments. In traditional animation, different assets would be drawn in separate cels to be superimposed later. In digital animation, this process is generally done in illustration software such as Photoshop, Illustrator and even After Effects itself. You can start with an illustration that contains a complete scene, with characters, environment and props, but having each of these parts as a separate element makes it much more manageable later on.\nImporting Assets in After Effects\nA very important part of asset import process is separating each element in its own layer. For example with a character, you'll need to have separate layers for the head, the torso, for different parts of each arm, for different parts of each leg, for each hand and each foot, and depending on the character, also for facial features that will be animated separately like the mouth and eyes. If this is not done properly you'll end up with a flat image that can't be animated at all.\nHow to separate layers in Adobe Illustrator:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1MmXRSpARlnlCaBB4WfWdnmmnq3QK-nj5\nWhen you finish preparing your assets in Photoshop or Illustrator, you can start importing them in After Effects.

This will set your resolution to HD and your frame rate to 24 frames per second.\n\nAnimation Workflow\nAnimating in After Effects is a very simple process once you get used to the interface and tools at your disposal.\nHere is a series of videos showing the animation process in After Effects (you will need your Lynda account to watch these videos):\nhttps://www.lynda.com/After-Effects-tutorials/Editing-interactively-Composition-panel/78544/79270-4.html\nhttps://www.lynda.com/After-Effects-tutorials/Editing-numerically-Timeline-panel/78544/79271-4.html\nhttps://www.lynda.com/After-Effects-tutorials/Animating-position/78544/559748-4.html\nhttps://www.lynda.com/After-Effects-tutorials/Editing-motion-paths/78544/79274-4.html\nhttps://www.lynda.com/After-Effects-tutorials/Animating-scale-rotation-opacity/78544/79275-4.html\nExporting your animation\nOnce your animation is done, you'll need to render it to a video file.

Keep in mind that the concept you are trying to convey is as important as the animation itself, so they must walk hand-in-hand throughout the process.\nGuidelines\nCreate the animation of a “living text” based on two contrasting ideas/emotions (for example happiness/sadness; love/hate; day/night; infrastructure/nature). Your animation should be approximately 15 seconds long. Feel free to use words, or a combination of words and other graphic elements (for example basic shapes). \nRemember, whatever the elements you plan to use, they must clearly convey your two contrasting ideas, so keep you animation simple and direct.\nSteps to completion\n\nA crucial component of creating animations is planning (steps 1-3). You should start by defining the two contrasting ideas/emotions you would like to convey. What comes to your mind when you think about them? Define the main assets you will use in your animation and sketch them by hand or using Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop. \n\nHow should you animate your assets to convey your two contrasting ideas? Think about the five digital animation properties you have learned in Lesson 4.\n\nYou are already familiar with storyboards, so create one by drawing the different frames of your animation. Start with the main frames and then fill in the frames in between (similarly to what you have done in Project 1). Indicate how you will apply the different digital animation properties you have selected to animate your text. Don’t forget to add short descriptions to each frame explaining how they contribute to express your contrasting ideas. \nIndicate how your animation will move from one frame to the next, paying attention particularly to how you intend to transition from the first idea/emotion to the next.\n\nNow it is time to start working on the different elements of your animation. Use Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop to create the different assets for your animation (including text and other graphic elements you plan to use). Remember, each element that will be animated needs to be in a separate layer.\n\nImport your assets into Adobe After Effects. If you don’t remember how to do this step, watch again the video available on Lesson 4.\n\nFinally, animate your assets using Adobe After Effects.

It relies on the development of interesting assets and on adding appeal as each component is introduced in the screen to tell a story, no matter how simple that story may be. It requires attention to detail!\nLet’s start by looking at the following example: a simple title sequence for an animation called ‘Ultra Burger’.\nAs seen in Lesson 4, first we need to create our asset, separate it in layers and import them into After Effects. We can then start animating each element. Here we animated the position of the different elements of the burger (bread, patty, cheese), the rotation and scale of the right-hand shimmer, and used a mask for the title:\nimg\">\nThis title sequence has all the assets that were previously defined, and they all appear following some of the basic animation properties we have learned, but this animation is not complete yet. The movement of each element is very linear and unappealing, and the animation lacks weight. So how can we improve this animation?\nTo address this question, we can look back to some of the always very important Animation Principles:\n\nTiming and Spacing\nEase in and Ease out\nSquash and Stretch\nExaggeration\nAnticipation\nFollow through and Overlapping action\nSecondary Action\nAppeal\n\nOne of the principles that relates directly to this case and could significantly improve the animation is Ease in and Ease out. We have already seen how this principle works in frame by frame animation, so let’s take a look at how it works inside After Effects and how we can apply it to create a more appealing ‘Ultra Burger’ title sequence.\n"},"audiotiming.html":{"url":"audiotiming.html","title":"Audio and Timing","keywords":"","body":"Audio and Timing\nAudio is an important aspect of animation. It adds interest and helps to highlight particular moments of a story, clarifying ideas and exacerbating emotional responses by the viewer. Audio can be used as the basis to define the entire animation process, dictating how and when all of the elements will move on screen.\nIf you don’t have an audio track to work with, it is a little harder to create a rhythm for your animation. But as you did when you created your ‘living text’ animation in Exercise 4, you can animate your elements based on a set time, making sure you preview it regularly so your animation doesn’t start dragging on.\nIn this lesson, however, you will learn to use audio as a starting point to create an animated representation of an audio sample in After Effects using simple shapes and text. The audio component of your animation can be can be a song that you like or a sentence from a movie. You will then use that sample to create your assets and sync your animation to the beats, instruments or words from the audio.\nWhen working with audio in After Effects it is useful to have a visual representation of your audio track to use as a reference for your animation process. This will definitely make the syncing process much easier. Start by visualizing your audio track’s waveform. To do that, import your audio in After Effects. Expand your audio layer, the Audio attribute, and finally the Waveform attribute. This is what you should see in your timeline:\n\nYou can have multiple audio layers for each animation, and you can control the volume of each layer independently by using the Audio Levels attribute.\nAnother common workflow to work with audio in After Effects is to make use of Markers to place visual cues of where your keyframes should be. In addition to that, you can keep the Ctrl key (Cmd on MacOS) pressed when dragging your time indicator to hear a real-time preview of your audio. By combining these techniques you will have a really solid visual guide of your audio track, and will be able to sync your audio and animation much more easily. \nHere is a quick introduction to these techniques for audio syncing in After Effects:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1YtOy0gQNcKoPKujof5Di7Z-r1AmqyYZ_\nHere is the finished animation with added effects and details:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1cG1GL6IqhRhutmIcsUdWt46t-_Q_PSi0\n"},"exercise-5.html":{"url":"exercise-5.html","title":"Exercise 5","keywords":"","body":"Exercise 5 - Shapes and sounds\nIn this exercise you will create an animated representation of music/audio sample of your choice using simple shapes and audio sync. Keep in mind that the purpose here is not only to sync audio to animation, but rather to use animation (of text or other graphic elements) to convey ideas/emotions this particular piece of music or audio evokes to you. \nA few examples combining music/audio and animation to introduce and support main concepts/ideas:\nMonster Inc. Titles\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVaoNxG8Ahg\nThe Incredibles End Credits\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJnfABHiCVQ\nGuidelines\nCreate an animated representation for a piece of music/audio using simple shapes and audio sync. Your animation should be between 10-20 seconds long.\nRemember, the goal here is not simply to have shapes and/or words that are synced to the music/audio, but rather to use animated shapes to tell a story, and share concepts and emotions that music/audio brings to your mind.\nSteps to completion\n\nAs in exercise 4, planning (steps 1-3) is crucial for achieving a great animation. First of all, you need to select the music/audio you will use in your animation. A great open source to look for music is the “Experimental” category in the Free Music Archive:\nhttp://freemusicarchive.org/\nWhat comes to your mind when you listen to it? What is the story, including concepts and emotions, you would like to tell with this music/audio? \nDefine the main assets you will use in your animation and sketch them by hand or using Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop. \n\nHow should you animate your assets together with the music/audio you have selected to convey the story you wish to tell? Think about all animation properties you have learned in Lesson 4 and 5 and how you could apply them in your animation.\n\nYou have already created two storyboards (Project 1 and Exercise 4), so employ this useful tool again to plan the different frames of your animation (by hand or using Adobe illustrator/Photoshop). Start with the main frames and then fill in the frames in between (similarly to what you have done before). Indicate how you will apply the different animation properties you have learned to animate your shapes and sync them to the various segments of your selected music/audio. \nDon’t forget to add short descriptions to each frame explaining how they contribute to express your ideas and how they progress in relation to the audio. Indicate how your animation will move from one frame to the next.\n\nUse Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop to create the different assets for your animation (including text and other graphic elements you plan to use). Remember, each element that will be animated needs to be in a separate layer.\n\nImport your assets into Adobe After Effects. If you don’t remember how to do this step, watch again the video available on Lesson 4.\n\nFinally, animate your assets using Adobe After Effects. Carefully test your timing to make sure each asset and transition is properly synced with the audio. Again, if you need, go back and make any necessary adjustments to your original assets.\nRemember, in this exercise your concept, assets, and audio must be all carefully aligned and are all crucial to assure the quality of your final animation, so devote time to work in each one of them separately and in combination when producing your final piece.\n\nTake a closer look into your complete animation and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nExport your final animation as an .mp4 video following this naming convention:\nart204_exercise5_lastname_firstname.mp4\n\nUpload the animation to your frame.io page and post the link on the course page.\n\n\n"},"project-2.html":{"url":"project-2.html","title":"Project 2","keywords":"","body":"Project 2 - Title Screen\nFor this project you will create a title sequence for the final animation you will develop for this course. A title sequence is much more than just a static screen where you show the name of your story. It gives you the opportunity to combine motion graphics and music to not only present the title of your story, but also to introduce and support its main ideas. Take another look at the title sequence for Monsters Inc. It not only introduces the title of the movie, but also the idea of monsters living behind bedroom doors. It is simple, yet creative, striking, and memorable.\nGuidelines\nUsing the concepts you have learned in lessons 4 and 5, and that you have practice in Exercises 4 and 5, and based on your short story (Exercise 2) and storyboard (Project 1), create a 5-10 seconds title sequence for you animation. \nKeep in mind, your title sequence doesn’t need to have a lot of elements. It should simply convey a clear message, introducing the main ideas of your animation by presenting a strong and clear concept, and/or evoking particular emotion(s). \nAdditional Examples and Resources\nCatch Me if You Can - Title Sequence, by Kuntzel + Deygas (2002)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaLDyrun_Cc&t=10s\nIt’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World - Title Sequence, by Saul Bass (1963)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1A7bJD3atk\n10 Best Opening Title Sequences of All Time, by CineFix (2016)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8twthdaqB8\nRound the Campfire, by Linn Fritz (2017)\nhttps://vimeo.com/232302303\nSteps to completion\n\nUsing your short story (Exercise 2) and storyboard (Project 1), create a title for your animation. Your title should preferably be short and clearly convey the main idea of your story. A way to approach the creation of your title is to list words that help you describe your character’s journey (for example your character’s name, the place where the story is taking place, what the journey is about). Then think which 1-4 words that best describe your story and try arranging them together to create a strong and compelling title. \n\nWhich other elements besides words your title bring to your mind and would help to introduce your story? List these different elements and make sketches by hand, or using Illustrator/Photoshop, depicting how your title and these elements could come together as a “mini animation” to introduce your story. \nThis is also a good moment to choose the music you will use for your title sequence. Remember that a great open source option to look for music is the “Experimental” category in the Free Music Archive http://freemusicarchive.org/. If the music you selected is too long, think about ways to edit it, so your title sequence audio doesn’t end too abruptly.\n\nThe next step is to put your storyboard skills into practice. Create a storyboard for your title sequence. The storyboard should contain all frames needed so you can think through the different elements, transitions, and how they relate to the music you have selected to present your animation’s title. \n\nCreate all different assets, including words and graphic elements, using Illustrator/Photoshop. Your title sequence should include the title of your animation, your name, and any other information you deem necessary and that can be presented in 5-10 seconds. Remember, each element that will be animated needs to be in a separate layer.\n\nImport your assets into Adobe After Effects. If you don’t remember how to do this step, watch again the video available on Lesson 4.\n\nAnimate all your assets using After Effects. As in Exercises 4 and 5, test different speeds for your animation, syncing it with your selected music. Achieving a good result takes time, so allow yourself enough time to experiment and try different things out. \n\nTake a closer look into your complete animation and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nExport your final animation as an .mp4 video following this naming convention:\nart204_project2_lastname_firstname.mp4\n\nUpload the animation to your frame.io page and post the link on the course page.\n\n\n"},"unit3.html":{"url":"unit3.html","title":"Unit 3","keywords":"","body":"Unit 3\nIntroduction to Character Animation\nOverview\nIn the two previous units you have learned the principles of animation, how they have progressed with the move from traditional to digital techniques, and also how to apply them using After Effects. Now it is time to move on to one of  the most important elements of any animation: the characters. Character design and animation are arguably two of the most complex parts of the animation process, and an entire course could be dedicated exclusively to those. In this Unit we will discuss how to create a compelling and memorable character. We will also talk about techniques for character animation. You will design and animate the main character for your final project, which you have already outlined in Unit 1, and you will test it in one of the scenes for your final project. At the end of this unit, you will have learned the principles for character design and how to create a character sheet. You will also understand concepts such as forward and inverse kinematics and character rigging, and you will be able to animate a character walk cycle.\nScreening\nWIND, (2013) Robert Loebel\nhttps://vimeo.com/80883637\nAnimating Ernest & Celestine\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILpNlfO6qMg&\n"},"unit3/storyboard/":{"url":"unit3/storyboard/","title":"Storytelling and Pre-production","keywords":"","body":"Storytelling and Pre-production\nStorytelling and Pre-production\nStorytelling\nThink about your favorite animated movie. What was the movie about? What was the main character's name? How did that movie make you feel?\nChances are, if you have a favorite animated movie, you remember the story by heart, the character's names and what they are like (funny, grumpy, quirky, smart). Depending on the movie, you might know the lyrics of the songs the characters sing, and you definitely remember how that movie made you feel. You may get emotional just thinking about a sad scene, because you care about those characters and what they have gone through. That is why story is the most important aspect of an animation.\nYou may create the most technically stunning animation you are capable of, but if you don't have an interesting story behind it, it probably won't engage the viewer. Animation, as any other art form, needs to be imbued with meaning, even if this meaning is not instantly noticeable.\nSo how do you write a meaningful story? There is no short answer to that, but a good start is to think about your own experiences in life and important memories you have. Some memories may be sad, or you might remember something that taught you an important lesson. If you remember it vividly, this might be a good start for a story. Don't confuse this with the idea that every story you write is specifically about you. What you want to focus on is the feeling you get, the emotion you feel when you remember something, and how you translate that feeling into a story. Also very important is how you transfer that emotion to other people. Make sure your story is relatable, and that other people understand what you are trying to convey.\nTry to keep your story simple, at least at first. Once you have a general idea of what your story is about, try to plan ahead and think how it all starts, and how it will end. This might help you to keep a clear goal and not get sidetracked. This doesn't mean that you can't change your mind though. Stories change and evolve constantly while you create them, so don't feel pressured to work on an idea just because it looked really good in the past, and don't be afraid of starting over.\nWriting doesn't have to be a lonely process. Look for other people's opinions and pay attention to their reaction to your story. Take all criticism and praise into account, but make sure to stay true to your vision. Remember this is your story and you are free to tell it any way you like.\nFinally, as you write your story, try to imagine it as a movie/animation. Ask yourself how does it translate to the screen, what do the characters and locations look like, and how does that affect the story itself. This will make the process of turning your story into an animation much easier later on.\nEmma Coats, a storyboard artist from Pixar has compiled a very helpful list of rules on how to create great stories and characters:\n\nYou admire a character for trying more than for their successes.\nYou gotta keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer. They can be very different.\nTrying for theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is actually about until you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.\nOnce upon a time there was ----. Every day, ----. One day ----. Because of that, ----. Because of that, ----. Until finally ----.\nSimplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.\nWhat is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?\nCome up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.\nFinish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.\nWhen you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.\nPull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognise it before you can use it.\nPutting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.\nDiscount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th – get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.\nGive your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience.\nWhy must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.\nIf you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.\nWhat are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against.\nNo work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on – it’ll come back around to be useful later.\nYou have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining.\nCoincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.\nExercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d’you rearrange them into what you DO like?\nYou gotta identify with your situation/characters, can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?\nWhat’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.\n\nPre-production\nPre-production is the planning period before any development is done. It is in this phase that your ideas and animation take shape as you better define characters, locations, story and as many other details as you can. The first step of pre-production is called...\nOutline\nThe outline is a document where you collect and organize all the elements of your story. This is a very important step in animation development, and very useful to not lose sight of the details about the plot, characters, etc.\nAn outline can have many forms. It can be a simple list or a collection of reference images, text and even sounds. It depends on what works better for you as an animator.\nThe main elements of an outline are:\n\nStory pitch or summarized plot:\nA short version of your story with all of the most important plot points. It can be presented as a couple of short paragraphs, or even bullet points. Your story pitch should answer some of these questions:\n\nWho is the main character and what are its objectives and motivations?\nWhat is the character's initial condition, and how does that change over the course of the story?\nWhat are the obstacles and conflicts the main character faces?\n\n\nCharacter profiles:\nEverything there is to know about the characters in your story. A few examples are:\n\nCharacter's name\nAge and/or date of birth\nfavorite food/color/type of music\nPersonality traits/general mood\nCatchphrases\nAnything else that may be essential to the plot (past traumas, goals in life, etc.)\n\nYou should strive to create characters with opinions and feelings, and that also have consistency. Even if most of the details you list in this step end up not making into a scene in your animation, the fact that you thought about them will help you create more believable characters.\n\nLocations:\nA list of locations with detailed descriptions. In this section you can specify:\n\nWhere and when does your story happen (in a space station, in an arcade in the 1980's, inside a kitchen). Describe each landscape and scenery, or use pictures/illustrations as reference.\nOverall mood of the place\nTime of day/weather/season\nHow does the location affects the characters\n\nDepending on your story, locations can be almost as important as a character, so make sure to think about your locations very carefully.\n\n\nWhen you finish your outline, and even as you organize and write your outline, you'll notice that your story evolves and sometimes can even change completely. This is a common ocurrence, so don't be afraid of rewriting your story as many times as you feel is necessary.\nOnce you complete this step, you are ready to start working on the...\nStoryboard\nStoryboards are a visual representation of your story. As the name suggests, it consists of a collection of illustrations or images, generally pinned to a board, showing your scenes in chronological order. Storyboards can be as detailed or as simple as you want, and you don't necessarily need to use an actual board, as even small thumbnails scribbled on paper should be fine, as long as that clearly conveys the ideas in your story.\nThe storyboard is and incredibly useful tool, and it contains a lot of information about your animation, such as:\n\n\"camera\" movement and scene composition\nIn a storyboard, you can define how a camera should be positioned, and also how it should move with the use of arrows inside or around the frame. \n\nscene cuts and action timing\nBecause of the chronological nature of the storyboard, you can use it to easily define when things will happen in a scene, and when one scene will cut to the next.\n\ncharacter and prop movement\nYou can pose and give the idea of movement to characters and and other elements by using arrows close to or around them. Here is a great example by Alex DeLeon: http://www.stayup.com/motorcycleStoryboard.jpg\n\nscene by scene description\nYou can write a short description of the scene under each frame of a storyboard. This helps to clarify any details that might be hard to convey in the frame.\n\nextras\nIf necessary, you can add details such as scene numbers, dialogue for each character, notes about color/mood/music, etc. The level of detail contained in a storyboard ultimately depends on how complex the animation is and what works for you.\n\n\nOnce the storyboard is in place, it serves as a guide for the entire production process, so it is important to take your time developing it and make sure that it is clear and easily understandable.\n"},"unit3/storyboard/exercise-1.html":{"url":"unit3/storyboard/exercise-1.html","title":"Exercise 1","keywords":"","body":"Exercise 1: Outline\nIn this exercise you will create an outline for a short story.

A great character design goes beyond creating a character that is visually appealing or complex. You want to develop characters people can relate to, characters they imagine meeting some day and sharing their stories. \nGreat characters invariably generate emotional responses from the viewers in the form of joy, sadness, compassion, anger, etc. You want people to feel something when they meet your character for the first time. You want them to root for your character and emotionally react when its journey comes to an end.\nDesigning a great character takes a lot of time. It involves trying out different shapes, colors, pieces of clothing, facial expressions, and types of movement (to name a few) in order to define features able to bring its personality to life.\nPixar character design for Russell, from the movie UP:\nhttp://pixar-animation.weebly.com/uploads/8/7/6/3/8763219/1384621_orig.jpg?654\nHere is a list of tips inspired by Pixar’s approach to character design, which can help you to develop a successful character:\n\nFind characters you like and try to answer these questions: \n\nWhat is it about these characters that make you like them?\nWhat are their particular personality traits?\nHow these traits translate into their physical appearance and into the way they move?\nHow do they fit within their stories? \n\n\nThink about your audience. Different audiences will have different tastes (for example, characters designed for small children usually have basic colors and shapes. See 'Pocoyo' and 'Hey Duggee' for characters designed with a very young audience in mind).\n\nMake sure your character is unique. If you decide to create a talking circle, what makes it different and more special than the other talking circles that already exist?\n\nExaggerate your character's features to make its personality pop.\n\nChoose colors and shapes that allude to your character's personality and emotions.\n\nIt is all about your character’s personality, so make sure it has a strong one! It doesn’t matter if your character is a hero or a villain, its personality must be interesting and clear, so your audience will have an emotional response to it.\n\nGive your character a range of emotions as your story evolves. This will help showcasing even more its personality. You don’t want to end up with a monotone character (unless that is part of your story!).\n\nGive your character something to look for, a flaw to overcome. This will make your character more complex and will hook the audience to look forward to a solution.\n\nCreate a backstory for your character. Where does your character come from? What are its past experiences? What big events shaped your character’s personality and the way it sees the world? Even if you won’t use it in your animation, a backstory helps to define your character’s personality and aspirations, and might be as interesting as its present journey. You might end up liking it so much, you you feel inspired to create an ‘origins’ story.\n\nCreate an interesting world for your character. The world you character lives in is as important to the story as the character itself, so spend time developing it.\n\nReflect upon and redraw everything you create. Try out different facial features, body shapes, pieces of clothing, props... Small changes can have a huge impact on your final animation, so spend time fine-tuning everything you create.\n\n\nYou can find more useful tips in Lesson 1, under Storytelling and Pre-production.\n"},"unit3/lesson-5-character-design-and-rigging/character-sheet.html":{"url":"unit3/lesson-5-character-design-and-rigging/character-sheet.html","title":"Character Sheet and Design Process","keywords":"","body":"Character Sheet\nThe design and animation of a character invariably relies on the production of a character sheet. A character sheet, also known as a model sheet, is a page traditionally created to portray a character’s ‘turnaround’, depicting it from different views (usually front, back, side, and ¾ angle). The sheet is also usually used to show the character in different poses. It can contain the character’s entire body or focus on a single section, such as its head/face. The character sheet is a very useful tool for character design, and later during production, serving as a guide to keep the character consistent.\nFor an example of a traditional character sheet see: \nhttp://www.traditionalanimation.com/wp-content/gallery/winnie-the-pooh/poohmodelsheet1.jpg\nCharacter sheets can also:\n\nPresent the inspiration for a character, describing where its shape(s) comes from. \nHeffer from Rocko’s Modern Life:\nhttp://www.traditionalanimation.com/wp-content/gallery/rockos-modern-life/HefferWolfe.gif\n\nShow how a character relates to other characters in the animation in relation to size, shape, personality, etc.\nPowerpuff Girls’ size comparison character sheet:\nhttp://www.traditionalanimation.com/wp-content/gallery/powerpuff-girls/powerpuffmodelsheet1.jpg\n\nDepict particular elements from a character that will inform the animation, describing how different parts of its body should behave and move, thus serving as a valuable reference during the animation process. \nPowerpuff Girls’ DOs and DON’Ts character sheet:\nhttp://www.traditionalanimation.com/wp-content/gallery/powerpuff-girls/powerpuffmodelsheet14.jpg\n\n\nThe character sheet is particularly important in animation processes involving larger teams. It serves as a guide that multiple artists and animators can follow to assure the character is consistently portrayed in the various scenes of an animation.\nCharacter Design Process\nThe design of a character always starts from basic shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) that will serve as the foundation for more complex forms. Think about your character. If you simplify it to the extreme, which simple shape or shapes are you left with? This quick exercise will help you to identify the foundational elements of your character, which will serve as the basis so you can consistently reproduce it in various situations and from several angles.\nAfter you have your basic foundation, you can move on to a more complex form. Use the initial simple shape(s) to draw your character’s outline. What other elements can you add to your character to portray its personality and tell your story? Play with different shapes, sizes, props. Try different colors. Draw as many iterations of your character as you can. Nobody, not even the most experienced artists, create a character in just one try. \nOnce you are satisfied with your initial character design, try drawing it from different angles. What do you see when your character turns around? You will certainly find out spots you didn’t even think about before and that must be further developed. This is your first character sheet and it shouldn’t be polished. During the design process, an artist will produce several ‘rough’ character sheets to create quick sketches and try out different character attributes. \nWhen you are happy with the overall look of your character, create a final sheet with a polished version of it. Be as detailed as possible and explain how you envision your character behaving and moving. This details will be crucial when you start the animation process.\nFollow this link for a collection of character sheets from major studios, including Disney, Warner Brothers, and Hanna-Barbera:\nhttp://www.traditionalanimation.com/animation-library/model-sheets/\n"},"unit3/lesson-5-character-design-and-rigging/exercise-5.html":{"url":"unit3/lesson-5-character-design-and-rigging/exercise-5.html","title":"Exercise 6","keywords":"","body":"Exercise 6 - Character Design\nIt is time to go back to the outline (Exercise 1.1), the short story (Exercise 2.2), and the storyboard (Project 1) you have created in previous exercises to develop your character design. \nTo design your character you will need to be attentive to:\n\nThe main traits of your character and how you can represent them through, for example, shape, color, clothing, props.\n\nThe way your character will move, as detailed in Lesson 6. \n\n\nKeep in mind that great animations have great characters that are relatable.

This will help us define what kind of rigging we will use for this character.\nRigging is the process of preparing a character to be animated, and it's like creating a character's bone structure. In this lesson we will study two different rigging methods, Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics, each with its advantages and disadvantages.\nBoth methods consist of parenting, or linking parts of a character to create a hierarchy. For example, we can parent the hand to the forearm, so when we move the forearm, the hand will follow. If we do that again between the forearm and the arm, we will create a hierarchy. This process makes animating a character much more efficient and intuitive.\nForward Kinematics (FK)\nIn Forward Kinematics, the parent object influences the child object in a hierarchical order. For example, the movement of the arm influences the movement of the forearm, which in turn influences the movement of the hand, as you can see in the animation below.\n\nThis method is really good for putting your characters in very specific poses, but it can also be very cumbersome and time consuming, since you have to manually rotate and position each section of the character separately.\nInverse Kinematics (IK)\nInverse Kinematics is faster to animate because it puts the the control of the hierarchy on the last child object in a hierarchy. In this case, instead of having to manually position and rotate each section of the arm separately, we only need to move the hand, and the rest of the arm will follow.\n\nThis makes it much quicker to pose a character, especially if you are creating a walk cycle, or moving the character's hips. On the image below, the character on the left is rigged using FK, and the one on the right is using IK. Both are being moved by their respective parent nodes (in this case, the hip node).\n\nFrom this simple comparison we can already see that the character on the right will be much easier to animate because it keeps its hands and feet positions in place as we move the character.\nThe downside of using IK is that it can be difficult to pose your character exactly as you want, since you lose control of each individual joint.\n"},"unit3/lesson-7-forward-kinematics-inverse-kinematics-and-walk-cycle/character-rigging.html":{"url":"unit3/lesson-7-forward-kinematics-inverse-kinematics-and-walk-cycle/character-rigging.html","title":"Character Rigging Process","keywords":"","body":"Character Rigging Process\nTo start rigging a character, first we need to have all of the character elements in separate layers and imported into After Effects. The next step is to position the anchor point of each piece properly.\nThe anchor point is what defines your layer's center of rotation. As an example, the center of rotation of an arm is the shoulder, while the center of rotation of the forearm is the elbow. For this reason it is very important to place the anchor points of your layers properly before you start rigging.\nTo move the anchor point of a layer, select the layer or object, click the Pan behind tool, then click the anchor point and move it to the desired position.\n\nWith the anchor points properly placed, we can decide if we'd like to create an FK or an IK rig.\nIn the case of Forward Kinematics, we start by parenting the layers to each other (for IK we can skip this step).\nTo parent one object to another in After Effects, all you need to do is click the pick whip icon and drag from the child layer, to the parent layer. The dropdown next to the pick whip will then show the name of the parent layer:\n\nOnce that is done, whenever you rotate or move the parent layer, the child layer will follow.\nTo create an Inverse Kinematics rig we will create controllers for each part of our character that will be animated. To simplify this process, we will use a free plugin called DUIK.\nHere is a step by step of the IK setup process with DUIK (you will need to use your Lynda account to watch these videos):\nDUIK Interface\nhttps://www.lynda.com/DUIK-tutorials/Duik-interface-preferences/492721/543492-4.html\nIK rigging setup\nhttps://www.lynda.com/DUIK-tutorials/Introduction-IK-rigging/492721/543495-4.html\nIK options\nhttps://www.lynda.com/DUIK-tutorials/Effects-panel-options-IK-control-layer/492721/543496-4.html\n"},"unit3/lesson-7-forward-kinematics-inverse-kinematics-and-walk-cycle/walk-cycle.html":{"url":"unit3/lesson-7-forward-kinematics-inverse-kinematics-and-walk-cycle/walk-cycle.html","title":"Walk Cycle","keywords":"","body":"Walk Cycle\nLet's stop for a moment and think about how a person walks. What movements are involved in the simple act of walking? How does the body keep its balance? \nWalking is one of the most basic forms of locomotion, and for that reason it is something that most people do not think about very much. As animators though, we need to observe the world around us, and gather references from the simplest things. For an animator, the act of walking is an intricate collection of poses and nuanced details.\nWalking is a naturally cyclic process. For this reason, one of the most important elements of a character's movement is what animators simply call a \"walk cycle\". The walk cycle is a looping animation of a character walking in place, and it not only serves to move the character around the scene, but it can also help define character traits and moods. A character might walk with confidence or run in fear, or it may drag its feet from tiredness or sadness. A walk cycle might show excitement or weariness, it may be purposeful or relaxed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEoUhlesN9E\nBecause of all the nuance a walk cycle can depict, it may seem like one of the hardest aspects of the character animation process. To simplify it, we can start by breaking down a walk cycle into a few simple poses:\n\nThese poses define the extremes of your walk cycle animation. The two most important poses are the contact and passing poses, since they dictate the step length and duration of the cycle. Recoil comes right after the contact pose and it is where the character is at its lowest point, while high point happens right after the passing pose, and it is where the character is at its highest point.\nIn After Effects, you'll only need the contact and passing poses to start. When you have created a base walk cycle, you can start defining the recoil and high point poses. This is all you'll need to make a character walk, since the inbetweens will be created for you.\nHere is a quick overview of the process of creating a basic walk cycle in After Effects:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=14M3OTNF4uPpFjgdcEsh-AbFvfSsp9Tdf\nObviously, if you stop at the initial poses, your walk will probably look very generic, so make sure to refine the inbetweens and the little details to create a walk cycle with more personality and appeal.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1T7Cl99EU7ElZ3MKiPXiWJzrEcl-Hfq_N\n"},"unit3/lesson-7-forward-kinematics-inverse-kinematics-and-walk-cycle/exercise-7.html":{"url":"unit3/lesson-7-forward-kinematics-inverse-kinematics-and-walk-cycle/exercise-7.html","title":"Exercise 7","keywords":"","body":"Exercise 7 - Character animation\nIn this exercise you will apply what you have learned in Lesson 7 to your own character’s animation.

Sometimes while creating characters or drawing environments, colorizing your illustrations can give a better idea of what that element represents in the story. While this may be a good idea early on as a way to create a better sense of each character's identity and the general mood of an environment, sometimes when putting these elements together the artist may realize that they have disparate color palettes, and their look do not match.\nThe simplest way to deal with this kind of situation is by using color grading, a process commonly used in film production. Color grading can be a very simple, or very involved process, depending on the desired result, and it is incredibly versatile. It can be used for brightness and saturation correction (sometimes referred to as color correction) or it can completely transform a scene, sometimes literally from day to night.\nColor grading tools can be found in pretty much every major editing and animation software such as Adobe Premiere, Adobe After Effects, Nuke, Avid, Final Cut, etc. There are also specialized color grading programs such as DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Speedgrade. In our case, we will use the built-in color grading tools in After Effects, since they are very easy to use but also very powerful.\nColor Grading in After Effects\nThere are a number of color grading tools in After Effects, and the most commonly used are:\nBrightness and Contrast\nThis one is very self explanatory. It controls the brightness and the contrast of a scene.\n\nLevels\nThe levels tool is a more nuanced way of controlling the brightness and contrast of a scene. It has separate control for the white and black portions of an image.\n\nHue and Saturation\nIn it's simplest use, this tool can be a way to introduce more color to your scene, or de-saturate it entirely by adjusting the \"saturation\" slider. In more advanced cases, it can be used to completely replace colors in a scene.\n\nCurves\nThe standard in color grading tools. As powerful as it is confusing for a beginner. The curves tool can control brightness, contrast, saturation, as well as red, green and blue levels separately, all in one neat interface. Once you understand how the curves work, you can change the mood of an entire scene using just this tool.\n\nLumetri Color\nThe latest addition to the color grading tools in After Effects is also the most versatile. It combines all of the functionality of the previously mentioned tools in just one interface. For this reason, it can be overwhelming or confusing at first, but since it is so powerful, this is the recommended tool to work with color correction in After Effects.\n\nHere is an example of color grading workflow in After Effects:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1bMSuo9HIixNQvG9naoEj8Lm6BATxasKy\nThe main thing to keep in mind when color grading is the mood of a scene, and how that mood transitions from one scene to the next. For example, high contrast and green/purple tones can lend a sense of mystery and tension. Desaturated and blue tones can have a sad or serious connotation. If it is a happy scene, maybe it needs more color.\n"},"unit4/camera.html":{"url":"unit4/camera.html","title":"Camera Effects","keywords":"","body":"Camera effects\nIn the moviemaking process, the camera is one of, if not the most important aspect. Everything in the development of a film revolves around what the camera sees, how it is positioned, if it is in movement or static, if it shows the point of view of a character or of an invisible spectator.\nWhile it is natural to think about the camera in relation to film development, when thinking about animation it may not be such a direct concept, since 2D animation is developed either entirely on a computer, or hand drawn frame by frame. At this point in the course you probably already realized that when we develop an animation, our mind is the camera. When we imagine how a scene will play out, the camera is there, giving us a sense of the composition of that scene.\nHow we position our camera and how we stage a scene in animation is very important, but it is equally important to direct the viewer's gaze to the important areas of a scene. This brings us back all the way to the beginning of the course, where we learned about the principle of animation called staging. This principle revolves around the idea that animated elements should be well distributed over a scene, and over time, so the viewer knows where to look and the story doesn't get lost. This is a great starting point, but we can greatly enhance this process with camera effects. These effects can be used to make our scenes more dynamic, give our environment more depth, and also give a better direction to the viewer about what is the most important element on screen at any given time.\nParallax\nParallax occurs when you have background elements further away from the camera, and foreground elements closer to the camera. When the camera moves, the elements that are further away move slower than elements that are up close, giving a 2D scene a sense of depth. The largest the distance between these elements, the more pronounced the effect is. The easiest way to apply parallax to a scene is to separate your elements in layers, and then animate them at different speeds.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1cst6p2yyU5fDxc8eSWm8EfadonQ59hbZ\nanimation elements separated in layers\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1DwhPsLhKDosww4ba-b8_eHB6tgPDW9F6\nanimation without parallax\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1kdEkQaxNNaoyYU4t1n8slxtxiegipIGN\nanimation with parallax\nDepth of Field\nDepth of field relates to the distance of an element in relation to the camera, and what element the camera is focusing on. When an element is in focus, it appears sharp, while other elements in different distances from the camera will appear blurred, or out of focus. This effects happens naturally when using a camera in real life, but in 2D animation the effects needs to be carefully planned and applied. When used well, it can add a great sense of depth to the scene. Since our eyes tend to give preference to focused images, it is also very effective to direct the viewer's gaze to important elements in the scene. The simplest way to simulate depth of field in a 2D animation is by applying the Gaussian Blur effect to different layers in After Effects.\nHere is a video on how to use Gaussian Blur to create depth of field in After Effects:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1LsdSznveVDv1tqvK33tUJCEAmjLoQNum\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1kdEkQaxNNaoyYU4t1n8slxtxiegipIGN\nanimation without depth of field\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=13nweFOhLqi6A2dzN4q9GiHK0AI_K6JWO\nanimation with far focus\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1sUOfTpaunlA_ulyaFS3FYAg6SD1NE_pS\nanimation with near focus\nVignette\nVignetting has its roots on an effect that resulted from the blocked light on the border of photographic lenses. This effect is achieved by fading the edges of a scene by using brightness, saturation or blur effects. Vignette is especially effective in directing the viewer's attention. It would originally be centered on the frame, but in animation we can use it more creatively to highlight different areas of an image.\n\nan example of the same scene with (left) and without (right) vignette\n\nvignette being used off-center to direct the viewer's attention\nThis video is a step-by-step on how to create a vignette effect:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1xVnezF6-OIqkOCnJDhTtSRO1axHJmnSQ\n"},"unit4/exercise-9.html":{"url":"unit4/exercise-9.html","title":"Exercise 8","keywords":"","body":"Exercise 8 - Color grading and scene mood\nIn Lesson 8 you have learned how to use color grading to correct the color in a scene and to completely alter its mood.
